          The Plural Good

        <div>
          Just as a signature is both uniquely mine and that which binds me to a world beyond myself, our state is both singular and shared. Recognising this paradox allows us to <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#signature-performances'>imagine individual interfaces</a> to collective information that do not replicate one dominant economic <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-7/no-paradigm/'>paradigm</a>, supposedly better than the last. Interfaces are the boundaries between distinct yet coextensive bodies; the places where we meet one another in our differentiated sameness; the personal routes to our shared root. Used <a href='https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#sig' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>creatively</a>, interfaces can be more like <a href='https://vimeo.com/483691027' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>permeable membranes</a> which are not premised on inclusion and exclusion, but on how information is passed between. Framing our exploration in terms of how bits are transmitted rather than who controls them may allow for many different concepts of value to interface with one another in creative ways which don’t incentivise cancerous growth, but are self-sustaining, resilient, and responsible.

          Realising all this requires one, simple recognition: wealth means “<a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://kernel.community/en/conversation/reciprocity/'>having enough to share</a>” because who you are is already enough.

          How can I take responsibility without the resources to make reading my signature worthwhile for others, though? I have tried to <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://medium.com/@cryptowanderer/merry-merkle-magic-1458a25ee2dd'>speak my imagination</a> into existence, and have seen the limits of such work. My signatures do not move markets. However, markets are not the arbiters of meaning, they are mechanisms for efficient resource allocation. Your signature is not made meaningful by its effects: your signature is meaningful by virtue of its singular existence. New forms of ignorance and <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://youtu.be/3HYlbg6RKMA?t=1145'>injustice will always appear</a>, yet knowing this and still having the creativity to iterate over incentive structures is what will continually imbue our shared record with <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://youtu.be/LwLP62fL83k?t=371'>true beauty</a>.
