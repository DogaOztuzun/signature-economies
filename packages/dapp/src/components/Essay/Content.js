                    Public blockchains present a paradox of ownership. No-one controls
                    them and anyone can use them, given a connection and an ability to
                    speak the common tongue. The network is ownerless, yet anyone who
                    creates a key ‘owns’ any coins associated with it, so everyone is an
                    owner. This confusion reveals how ‘ownership’ is shifting and
                    highlights the opportunity we have not to implement an ‘ownership
                    economy’, but to reimagine what being an owner means.
                </div>
                <div>
                    We can begin this process by asking, “What do I actually control?”

                <div>
                    In Bitcoin, I can sign over an unspent transaction output to another
                    address. In Ethereum and other account-based models, I can sign a
                    message which changes a value stored in shared state<sup>1</sup>. In
                    each case, I am not the sole possessor or controller, I am a
                    signatory on an event shared with everyone who participates in the
                    network.

                <div>
                    So, ownership in digital economies is really about the meaningful
                    signatures required to execute state changes while maintaining
                    consensus. Is ownership shifting from an ability to demonstrate
                    control or{' '}

                    to the ability to make collective meaning? If so, the change in signification

                    The Plural Good
                </div>
                <div>
                    How does making a sign differ from exerting control or claiming possession? Once claimed,
                    possessed or controlled, the story is forced to a close, which is why the ‘ownership economy’ is singular.
                    Someone wins and everyone else loses. However, your signature is at once totally unique—there
                    is only one in the whole world—and yet it can be made many times over without losing meaning.
                    So it is that we can talk of Signature Economies in the plural, while still remembering that such plurality
                    is made meaningfully valuable by individual speech acts within and across a shared, public ledger.
                    To quote Wendell Berry, “Perhaps our most serious cultural loss in recent centuries is the knowledge
                    that some things, though limited, are inexhaustible.”
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    As the meaning of ‘ownership’ shifts, it drags other critical terms along with it,
                    like ‘social security’. This has a cascading effect, such that words
                    like ‘welfare’ may come to mean more than just financial stability secured by bureaucratic states,
                    signifying—in addition to the financial—our access to and participation in “authentic communication
                    channels” through which we establish, by consensus, shared and open state.
                    In this context, and keeping in mind our responsibility not just for our own keys but the recovery of others,
                    “Make meaningful economies” is a more crafty
                    <sup>3</sup> cultural signal than “Own your piece of the economy”.

                    The phrase ‘not your keys, not your coins’ is often used to connote
                    sovereign rights. If you hold the keys, then you have an absolute
                    and unimpeachable right to sign as you please. It turns out, though,
                    that managing your own keys is risky and hard. The user experience
                    of this is bad not because we lack great designers, but because
                    responsibility is an inherently difficult feature for which to
                    design<sup>4</sup>. This is because response-ability is not about
                    discrete, individual actions which release the most dopamine, but
                    our <strong>unique relationships within a network</strong>.

                    audience, and are subject to someone else’s story. However, signed
                    messages which change the state of a network no-one controls require
                    recurring participation as we commit individual transactions into a

                    The word ‘economies’ contains this same double-directedness. It
                    comes from the Greek <i>oikos</i>, which means ‘house’. Sustainable
                    household management requires micro insights into each of our
                    habits, as well as macro perspectives of our shared habitations,
                    including the planet which{' '}

                    . Home is an irreducible, internal feeling that simultaneously
                    requires relationship and familiarity with others.

                    Similarly, meaningful words arise due to individual creativity

                    name (or code) the dao; it just means we can iteratively sign into
                    existence the kinds of shared state which will allow individuals to
                    experience harmoniously what words like dao signify in their

                    There is also another connotation waiting for us in the word
                    ‘economy’: to use sparingly. The messages we sign as a means of
                    maintaining our shared record cannot be censored by anyone, but they
                    can be seen by everyone, so be careful what kinds of money you make
                    meaningful. With programmable power comes permanent accountability.
                    To better understand the deeper meaning of 'power', though, we once
