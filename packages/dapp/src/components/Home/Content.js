          This is an <strong>interactive essay</strong> which explores what it means to own.
        </div>

          Traditionally, ownership is about control and possession.

          Kernel asks a simple question, over and over again:
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>How can we use technology to cultivate more reciprocal relationships?</strong>
        </div>
        <hr className='w-2/3 mx-auto pt-6' />
        <div>
          To augment the meaning of words like 'ownership', we need media which act out what they say. This text encourages three kinds of <strong>trans-action</strong>:

          <strong>1. Craft</strong> an Ethereum signed message of the whole essay. This is entirely free, and your signature is added permanently to the document.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>2. Highlight</strong> any text you find most meaningful, mint it as an NFT, and share it. You only pay gas fees, and may sell or transfer the NFT anywhere and to anyone you like. A 10% royalty fee on secondary sales will be sent to Kernel.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>3. Mint</strong> a "Sealed NFT". These are dynamic images that change depending on the amount used to mint them. All funds are sent to Kernel. Such seals are{' '}<a href='https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/playdough-protocols/#faith-and-finance' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>the original link between faith, finance, money and writing</a>.
        </div>
        <div>
          All funds will be used transparently, as we keep cultivating <a href='https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-6/learn/#a-surprisingly-educated-public' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>open educational webs</a>. While seal holders will not have governance rights, we will explore and suggest healthy ways to encourage your participation in the never-ending story of peer-to-peer learning.
        </div>
        <div>
          There is no limit on the number of seals that can be minted. However, over time, new seals might appear. This means these particular seals are only guaranteed to be available until September 9th, 2022.

          Our deep intention with this work is to <strong>find balance</strong>. Kernel will always remain open-source and, like all such goods, must find creative ways of sustaining itself. These ways must reflect what <a href='https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>we teach</a>, and so we present this as an invitation to ongoing conversation about what wholesome funding mechanisms might look like in web3. It is not just financial, but it includes the financial within a wider view of what it means to "make" money. As our friends have taught us: <a href='https://www.kernel.community/en/conversation/thanksgiving' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>balance must always come from where there is more</a>. We hope this offering inspires you to participate, and opens up a path for you to make an impact in ways which you find to be most significant. The story is just beginning, and we welcome any sign of your participation as we shape it together from here.
