          Poetry, well placed, <br />
          can serve up <br />
          a subversive education <br />
          in potent signs, <br />
          drawing out what is <br />
          already within <br />
          so we can wake <br />
          the dream into reality. <br />
      </div>
      <div>
          Peer into this paradox <br />
          without possessing it. <br />
          Play the nebulous pattern <br />
          of you through all <br />
          the others who care, <br />
          key pairs sharing what comes, <br />
          meaning they make wealth <br />
          between the curves <br />
          of this created web <br />
          we now call home. <br />
      </div>
      <div>
          There is the courage <br />
          in each heart <br />
          to hear truth <br />
          and bear witness <br />
          and lay no claim. <br />
      </div>
      <div>
          Simply sign it on,
          <br /> my soul.
